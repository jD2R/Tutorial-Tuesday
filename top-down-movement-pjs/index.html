            <h2>Tutorial Tuesday</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to my new series, Tutorial Tuesday! It's a challenge to
            myself to put out a quality tutorial every week on Tuesday. This
            week, inspired by my recent escapades into memes involving top-down
            movement, I've decided to put out a tutorial detailing how and why
            my method for this works. Let's jump right in.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
            This tutorial is written and intended for beginners. If you're not a
            beginner, you might find that much of the material is below you. If
            this is the case, don't just leave. Take the time to find something
            to add and leave a comment to help us all learn :)
        </p>
        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            What do I mean by top-down movement? It's movement, usually
            incorporated into a game, where the object in question is seen from
            the <b>top-down</b>, so from their top to their bottom. It's kind of
            like having a drone above the player that stays exactly above it at
            all times and looks down. The concept might be familiar if you've
            ever played an io game, as many of them follow this principle.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to make something like this? Actually pretty simple. It's all
            about using some base game development principles in the right ways.
            The principles in question?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>instant keypress detection</li>
            <li>velocity and movement</li>
            <li>player object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Aren't familiar with one or more of these? No sweat, I'll be going
            over each in more detail as we work through. Let's start with key
            detection.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Handling</h3>
        <p>
            I've discussed this method in detail before, but I still see people
            doing this so I'm gonna do it again.
        </p>
        <p>
            PJS provides two functions that we need: <code>keyPressed</code> and
            <code>keyReleased</code>. But we can't just work with these alone:
            we need a new variable to hold all of the keypress actions. I'm
            going with an object because it's more efficient.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  var keys = {};
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Nice, that's simple. That variable will hold all of the actions we
            want. Now, let's add the following code.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  var keys = {};
  keyPressed = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = true;
  };
  keyReleased = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = false;
  };
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            And that's the ballgame. Those seven lines of code are all you need
            to create robust games that require key input, like the example
            we're about to make. To see more about how it works, head over
            <a
                href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/key-detector-example/6637985703706624"
                target="_blank"
                >here</a
            >.
        </p>
        <h3>Velocity and Player Movement</h3>
        <p>
            In order to actually rig things up, we're going to need to go deeper
            into objects - so I'll save that for a bit. Here's how making the
            player move would actually work.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, how would the player move? We'll accomplish this by
                hooking the key events up to the player's position so that
                pressing arrow keys will change the position.
            </li>
            <li>
                But wait - I was promised smooth movement. Changing just the x
                and y won't give me smooth movement. We'll solve this issue with
                velocities (xv and yv).
            </li>
            <li>
                How about when the player hits the edges? We'll solve this using
                the built-in PJS <code>constrain</code> function.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Let's get started with the first point - changing the x and y of the
            player. Writing out some pseudocode we would get the following.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    variable keys (holds the keypress actions)

    inside the player function:
        if up arrow pressed:
            change player y by -1
        if down arrow pressed:
            change player y by 1
        if left arrow pressed:
            change player x by -1
        if right arrow pressed
            change player x by 1
        </code></pre>
        <p class="small">
            Wait, what's pseudocode? Good question! It's not real code that the
            computer can understand, but rather it's a rough mock-up of the
            steps our program would take to get to our desired output. If you're
            writing a huge algorithm, do you think you're really just going to
            sit down and write it up first try? No way! Using pseudocode can
            help us organize our thoughts in a code-ish way so that it's easier
            to translate those thoughts to actual code later.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
            Another note - there are actual standards for pseudocode, but if you
            know me you might know that I'm not terribly fond of following hard
            rules. I use my own pseudocode in this lesson, but your pseudocode
            can look however you want it to as long as it accomplishes its
            purpose. Get in the habit of writing it before any program - I
            promise it'll speed up development time.
        </p>
        <p>
            So that's nice. But it honestly won't end up looking very smooth,
            because smooth movement is about gradually slowing to a stop - not
            suddenly stopping whenever the key is not being held down. Let's
            make it smooth with velocity.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    variable keys (holds the keypress actions)
    
    inside the player function:
        if up arrow pressed:
            change player yv by -1
        if down arrow pressed:
            change player yv by 1
        if left arrow pressed:
            change player xv by -1
        if right arrow pressed
            change player xv by 1

        change player x by player xv
        change player y by player yv

        slowly decrease player xv
        slowly decrease player yv
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Now this is super important. By using a separate variable and
            changing the position by that variable, we'll achieve smoother
            movement when we gradually scale the velocity down.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
            Could you use vectors? Yes, of course you could use vectors. Should
            you use vectors? Maybe. Depends on your skill level. I'm going to be
            completely honest though, this works absolutely fine. Just save me
            heartache and don't use PVector. It's so slow you're better off
            using separate variables like this.
        </p>
        <p>
            You know what's funny? That's it. Wait - almost it, I lied. We have
            to incorporate one more tiny detail in our pseudocode - constraining
            the player to inside the canvas.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    variable keys (holds the keypress actions)
        
    inside the player function:
        if up arrow pressed:
            change player yv by -1
        if down arrow pressed:
            change player yv by 1
        if left arrow pressed:
            change player xv by -1
        if right arrow pressed
            change player xv by 1

        change player x by player xv
        change player y by player yv

        slowly decrease player xv
        slowly decrease player yv

        clamp player x in range (player width / 2, width of canvas - player width / 2)
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            So that's nice. Just a small note, the constraining was made with
            centered rectangles in mind - so I'll need to make sure to center my
            player when I draw him. Let's get into the OOP.
        </p>
        <h3>Making the Player Object</h3>
        <p>
            Making the object won't be terribly difficult if you're familiar
            with objects - in fact, we've already covered objects by talking
            about the key detector (<code>keys</code> is an object). Let's begin
            by creating a simple player object.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
    var player = {
        x: width / 2,
        y: height / 2,
        w: 40,
        h: 40
    };
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Just to let you know if you weren't aware, <code>width</code> and
            <code>height</code> are the width and height of the PJS canvas. Now,
            we make a draw and move function incorporating our pseudocode
            translated to JS code.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    var player = {
        x: width / 2,
        y: height / 2,
        w: 40,
        h: 40,

        xv: 0,
        yv: 0,

        draw: function() {
            noStroke();
            fill(0, 0, 0);
            rect(x, y, w, h);
        },
        move: function() {
            if (keys[LEFT]) {
                this.xv--;
            }
            if (keys[RIGHT]) {
                this.xv++;
            }
            if (keys[UP]) {
                this.yv--;
            }
            if (keys[DOWN]) {
                this.yv++;
            }

            this.x += this.xv;
            this.y += this.yv;

            this.xv *= 0.8;
            this.yv *= 0.8;

            this.x = constrain(this.x, this.w / 2, width - this.w / 2);
            this.y = constrain(this.y, this.h / 2, height - this.h / 2);
        }
    };
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            Bing. Bang. Boom. There's our player object. Now, updating is as
            simple as calling draw and move from a draw function with a
            background.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
    // -- snip --
    draw = function() {
        background(255, 255, 255);
        player.draw();
        player.move();
    };
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            That's it. Nope, not kidding. That's literally it. If you'd like to
